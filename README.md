# PythonProjects
These are some projects I created using Python, Django, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Projects:

- [Checkbook App](https://github.com/ericlemiere/PythonProjects/tree/main/Django_Projects/Django_Checkbook)
- [University App](https://github.com/ericlemiere/PythonProjects/tree/main/Django_Projects/DjangoUniversity)
- [Student Tracking GUI](https://github.com/ericlemiere/PythonProjects/tree/main/Student_Tracking)
- [File Transfer GUI](https://github.com/ericlemiere/PythonProjects/tree/main/File_Transfer)
- [Phonebook GUI](https://github.com/ericlemiere/PythonProjects/tree/main/Phonebook)


### Checkbook App:
Using Django, this web-based application is a simple example of a banking app that allows for creating new accounts, checking balances in existing accounts, and making deposits and withdrawals.

### University App:
Also using Django, this web-based application is a simple database a school might use to input offered courses with the course title, instructor name, etc.

### Student Tracking GUI:
With this interface, a user can input new students with their names, phone numbers, email addresses, and current course into a database. Once entered, those students can be deleted or updated, and the GUI lists the students in alphabetical order by last name.

### File Transfer GUI:
This program searches one folder for any file that has been updated in the last 24 hours, and copies those files to another folder. The GUI allows a user to select which folder to search and which folder the files are copied to. 

### Phonebook GUI:
This project functions as a phonebook for a user. It saves a contact's name, phone number, and email address in a database and allows the user to update, delete, or add new contacts to the database.
